In these provided cores it is found that grayscale (cvtColor) and erode works fine 
But ImgProc, sobel cores dont work fine or work as in the case of Benjamin project. They seem to give a more darker Sobel filtering implementation while Benjamin HA IP for sobel is much brighter.......Discuss with Munish whether there is problem with these HA IPs or both are fine to use!
