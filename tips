-- first boot from flash by creating a zynq image + downloading it onto flash..........then if you debug it using system_debugger in SDK then 
   even though debug config has cpu0 application and no knowledge of cpu1 still it will show cpu1 in suspended state at 0xffffff00 i.e in parked
   state by flash!!
