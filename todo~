After discussion with Munish, following tasks need to be carried out:

-- Carry out Lab09 (dual processor SW developement) in trainig videos
-- In SDSLabwork, we have done grayscale processing on realtime videos on single ARM core in a bare-metal application (no OS). Do the same application using
   both ARM cores i.e both cores running the same application (1 core processing even frames; other core processing odd frames) independently and see 
   performance advantages.
-- Then use the same methodology for main video processing application (sobel + erode + grayscale) for pure SW architectures

-- Then use the same methodology for main video processing application for architectures containing hardware accelerators. Now there are a lot of possibilities like
   HAs with one core and no HA with the other; HAs with both cores etc   
   
   
   
-- After doing this corner (bare-metal + 2cores), move onto the next corner (OS (possibly Linux-SMP) + 2cores)
