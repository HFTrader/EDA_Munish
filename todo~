After discussion with Munish, following tasks need to be carried out:

-- Carry out Lab09 (dual processor SW developement) in trainig videos
-- In SDSLabwork, we have done grayscale processing on realtime videos on single ARM core in a bare-metal application (no OS). Do the same application using
   both ARM cores i.e both cores running the same application (1 core processing even frames; other core processing odd frames) independently and see 
   performance advantages.
-- Then use the same methodology for main video processing application (sobel + erode + grayscale) for pure SW architectures

-- Then use the same methodology for main video processing application for architectures containing hardware accelerators. Now there are a lot of possibilities like
   HAs with one core and no HA with the other; HAs with both cores etc   
   
   
   
-- After doing this corner (bare-metal + 2cores), move onto the next corner (OS (possibly Linux-SMP) + 2cores)

Progress log
------------

-- On 13/04/2015, the simple gray-scale multicore was developed. After discussion with Munish on 15/04/2015, it is decided that it is OK for both cores to write at the same memory  
   locations and no need to alternate HDMI between two seperate memory regions.

-- Next tasks
   ----------
	-- verify via some timestamps that indeed each frame is being proccessed by the core and no frame is being missed and 'writing of frame to location by one core' is not
           overlapped with 'reading that frame for HDMI'
	   ( using the variable in the shared memory b/w the 2 cores, it is verified that each odd frame is being handled by CPU0 and each even frame by CPU1 within the same memory
	     space without any conflicts! )
	   DONE!!

        -- if verified, introduce Hardware accelerators into the system (like in labD)......1st use 2 HAs one for each core.......then see if it is possible to have one HA in the system
           which is shared b/w the 2 cores via semaphore for grayscaling process
