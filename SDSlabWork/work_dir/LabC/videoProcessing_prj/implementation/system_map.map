WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <cam_interface_0_OV7670_PCLK_pin> is placed at site <W10>. The
   corresponding BUFGCTRL component <cam_interface_0_OV7670_PCLK_pin_IBUFG_BUFG>
   is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y3>. The clock IO can use the fast path between
   the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site
   that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP
   or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it.
   This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <cam_interface_0_OV7670_PCLK_pin.PAD> allowing your
   design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related
   to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as
   it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error
   condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
